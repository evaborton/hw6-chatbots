QUESTION 1 - Anthropomorphizing

Is there potential for users of your chatbot possibly anthropomorphize 
(attribute human characteristics to an object) it? 
What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? 
Can you think of any ways that chatbot designers could ensure that users can easily 
distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?
"""

Q1_your_answer = """

There is pottential for users of our chatbot to possibly anthropomorphize it. 
A possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems include false confidence of 
users in these systems. The stakes are not as high in our movie recommendation chatbot, 
but for a system who is highly human-like (ChatGPT) and also tends to hallucinate facts, 
false confidence in the chatbot can be dangerous. Another possible problem is creating distrust
and frustration for users. If the chatbot fails to understand common sense (despite "speaking" like a human), the 
user might get frustrated and distrust the chatbot.

QUESTION 2 - Privacy Leaks

One of the potential harms for chatbots is collecting and then subsequently leaking 
(advertly or inadvertently) private information. Does your chatbot have risk of doing so? 
Can you think of ways that designers of the chatbot can help to mitigate this risk?

QUESTION 3 - Effects on Labor

Advances in dialogue systems, and the language technologies based on them, could lead to the automation of 
tasks that are currently done by paid human workers, such as responding to customer-service queries, 
translating documents or writing computer code. These could displace workers and lead to widespread unemployment. 
What do you think different stakeholders -- elected government officials, employees at technology companies, 
citizens -- should do in anticipation of these risks and/or in response to these real-world harms?

QUESTION 4 - Refelection 

You just built a frame-based dialogue system using a combination of rule-based and machine learning 
approaches. Congratulations! What are the advantages and disadvantages of this paradigm 
compared to an end-to-end deep learning approach, e.g. ChatGPT? 
"""

Q4_your_answer = """

The main advatage of this paradigm is that it is intepretable. It is also modular, which makes it easy to 
implement and debug. However, this system is not very generalizable and high performing as an end-to-end 
deep learning approach such as ChatGPT.
